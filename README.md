# REST Countries API-Frontend Mentor Challenge

This is my submission for the [REST Countries API with color theme switcher](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca), using [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/) to request data.

It has all the features requested in the Brief. I have used vanilla Javscript as well as vanilla CSS.
